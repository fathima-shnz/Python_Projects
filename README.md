# 🐍 Python Projects

Welcome to my **Python Projects** repository!  
This collection includes three end-to-end data analysis projects built using **Python** — focused on uncovering insights from real-world datasets in marketing, customer behavior, and feedback analysis.

Each project highlights data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and storytelling through visual insights.
